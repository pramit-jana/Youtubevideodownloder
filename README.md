# Youtubevideodownloder
This is a Python script that uses the PyTube library and Flask web framework to create a simple web application that allows users to download YouTube videos. The script provides a form to enter the video URL and displays the available download options. When the user selects a download option, the script uses PyTube to retrieve the video stream's data and saves it to a BytesIO buffer, which is returned to the user as a Flask response. 

FIX 2 ISSUES
1)Style the index page and download page
2)When i download a video it shows the video name this "myYouTube.mp4". Its name should be the video's title.
